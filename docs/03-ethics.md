# Ethics Framework

Bloodi operates within a strict ethical framework aligned with international public health standards and the fundamental principle that blood donation
must remain voluntary, altruistic, and free from coercion.

This framework exists to protect donors, preserve public trust, and ensure that technological innovation does not undermine ethical norms.

## Voluntary and Altruistic Donation
Blood donation within the Bloodi ecosystem is always voluntary. No individual is pressured, coerced, or economically incentivized
to donate blood.

Bloodi explicitly rejects models that treat blood or donors as commodities.

## Prohibition of Monetary Compensation
Bloodi does not provide direct or indirect monetary compensation for blood donation.

Financial incentives, payments, or tradable assets linked to donation events are prohibited, as they risk undermining ethical standards
and public trust.

## Acceptable Forms of Recognition
Bloodi supports non-monetary recognition mechanisms that:
- acknowledge donor commitment
- promote preventive health awareness
- strengthen community engagement

Such recognition must never influence medical eligibility decisions or donor safety assessments.

## Medical Independence
Medical decisions, including donor eligibility and screening, remain exclusively under the authority of qualified medical professionals and institutions.

Bloodi does not override, influence, or replace medical judgment.

## Donor Safety and Well-being
Donor safety takes precedence over operational efficiency or system performance.

Any system behavior that could compromise donor health must be corrected or suspended.

## Consent and Autonomy
Participation in Bloodi requires explicit, informed consent. Donors retain autonomy over their participation and may withdraw without penalty or loss of recognition.

## Equity and Non-Discrimination
Bloodi systems must not discriminate based on race, gender, nationality, socioeconomic status, or other protected characteristics.

Access to participation and recognition must remain equitable.

## Accountability and Ethical Review
Ethical considerations are subject to ongoing review. Governance structures must include mechanisms to address ethical concerns,
conflicts of interest, and unintended consequences.

Ethical integrity is not a compliance requirement for Bloodi. It is the foundation of its legitimacy.
