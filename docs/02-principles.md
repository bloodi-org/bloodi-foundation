# Principles

Bloodi is founded on a set of non-negotiable principles that guide all technical, organizational, and institutional decisions.

These principles exist to protect donors, preserve public trust, and ensure long-term sustainability as a public-good infrastructure.

## 1. Human Lives First
All decisions within Bloodi prioritize human life and public health outcomes over efficiency, growth, or institutional convenience.

## 2. Donor Dignity and Respect
Blood donors are not resources or commodities. Their participation is voluntary, informed, and must always be treated with respect, recognition, and ethical consideration.

## 3. Privacy by Design
Privacy is not an optional feature. Bloodi systems are designed from the ground up to minimize data exposure, avoid centralization of sensitive information, and protect donor identity.

## 4. No Sale or Exploitation of Medical Data
Bloodi does not sell, trade, or monetize medical data. Personal health information is never used for commercial purposes.

## 5. No Monetary Incentives for Donation
Bloodi does not provide direct financial compensation for blood donation. Recognition mechanisms must align with international ethical standards
and avoid coercion or undue influence.

## 6. Neutrality and Interoperability
Bloodi operates as a neutral layer. It does not compete with existing institutions but enables interoperability across organizations, regions, and systems.

## 7. Transparency and Observability
Operational transparency is essential for trust. Bloodi commits to observable system behavior, auditable processes, and clear communication of system health and limitations.

## 8. Consent-Based Participation
All participation in Bloodi is explicit and consent-based. Donors retain agency over their participation and identity representation.

## 9. Long-Term Stewardship
Bloodi is designed for longevity. Short-term optimization must never compromise ethical integrity, public trust, or future interoperability.

These principles are binding. Any future implementation, partnership, or governance decision must be evaluated against them.
